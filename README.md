# TDD DSA

## Description
TDD DSA is a technical assessment project aimed at demonstrating proficiency in Test Driven Development (TDD) while implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. This project is part of an interview process for a potential employer.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Jest (Testing framework)
- Git (Version control)

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Directory for DSA implementations
- `tests/`: Directory for Jest test files
- `README.md`: This file

## Instructions for Running Tests
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

## Purpose of the Technical Assessment
The purpose of this assessment is to showcase proficiency in implementing DSA concepts using Test Driven Development methodology. The project aims to demonstrate clean coding practices, modular code structure, and adherence to TDD principles.

## Commit Hooks
This project is configured with commit hooks to ensure that all changes are tested before being committed. Jest tests will be automatically run before allowing a commit, ensuring the integrity of the codebase.

## Future Improvements
- Add additional DSA implementations and corresponding tests.
- Improve test coverage and edge case handling.
- Enhance documentation and code comments for better clarity and maintainability.
